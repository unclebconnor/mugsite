        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Mug is the latest musical project by Brian Connor, formerly of The Minor Three and a contributing guitarist to The Sound Down Cellar collective in Boston, though he has recently found his home in the Pacific Northwest.  With a gentle growl delivering bold, haunting lyrics, woven through deceptively simple guitar lines, the songs are a familiar sort of Americana but look back at you with a restless, wandering psychedelic gaze; a collection of vignettes and hard truths, memories and dreams, tastefully arranged on the mantle above a crackling fire.  Mug has begun working on an EP titled “Union”, to be released in 2019.</p>
